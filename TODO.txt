	Gameplay:
		Placing armies:
			Card reimbursements:
				Allow human player to trade back cards for armies
				Add dumb logic for AI to trade back cards
				Enforce card trading when 5+ cards are in hand
		Taking turns:
			Get the turn taking loop working
		Battles:
			Allow the human player to attack
			Pause between attacks on AI turn
			When a player is eliminated, give their cards to the victor
			Detect the final battle
				Play special music
				Tell the user that it's the final battle
	AI:
		Better calculation for number of armies to transfer after defeating a country
		Better logic for AI attacks
		AI speed (ie, pause time between moves)
		AI difficulty
	Players:
		Support local human players (on the same device)
		Support remote human players (playing over the net)
	Settings:
		Players:
			Allow user to name players
			Give players default names based on color or number
			Choose player colors
			Add pop-up menu with a table for all the player settings
			When selecting number of players, give up and down buttons for mobile
		Sounds:
			Volume control
		Skins:
			Choose music themes
			Choose skins
			Tie a skin to its associated music theme, but also let them be chosen separately
		AI:
			AI speed (ie, pause time between moves)
			AI difficulty
	Skins:
		Support different maps
		Ensure that continent logic works for different maps
		Allow URL routes to skins (either as a param or a /)
	Sounds:
		Music:
			Load intro music at game load
			Support music themes
			Scrape and upload different songs
			Add different types of music to different parts of the game
		Sound effects:
			Support effects

	Misc/Organization:
		Rename playerOrder to turnOrder?
		Refactor playerOrder, playerColors, etc to all be in a players array or object?
		Combine getCountry and getContinent?
		Move helpers to another file (or maybe organize code into more than 2 files using logical breaks)
	Bugs:
		The first army is placed for me when I go first and I am using manual placement
		Make "Would you like to start a new game?" work when changing new game settings
		Fix formatting on t-rex-runner mini-game when called using param (or remove param support)
	
DONE:
	Bugs:
		Sometimes the AI picks my contry while placing armies
		Why are the countries showing the wrong name during AI attack?
		Why are no attacks being made by AI? (Global vars weren't being reset)
		When attacking, sometimes the AI leaves its own countries with 0 armies
	Gameplay:
		Placing armies:
			Initial placement:
				Wait for the human player to place an army before the AI places their next army
				Add logic for option to claim contries manually (random placement already works)
			Refactor getRandomCountry() to filter on valid countries
			Turn-based placement:
				Calculate number of armies for reinforcement phase
		Battles:
			Add dumb logic for AI to attack
			After a win, transfer armies from the attacking country to the defending country
	Players:
		Allow for more than 2 players
		Support AI players
	Settings:
		Move mute to settings
	Sounds:
		Music:

	Gameplay:
		Placing armies:
			Card reimbursements:
				Allow human player to trade back cards for armies
				Add dumb logic for AI to trade back cards
				Enforce card trading when 5+ cards are in hand
		Taking turns:
			Get the turn taking loop working
		Battles:
			Pause between attacks on AI turn
			Use dice for battles
				Show which country is attacking which
				Show remaining armies on each country
				Support dice for AI attacks
			When a player is eliminated, give their cards to the victor
			Detect the final battle
				Play special music
				Tell the user that it's the final battle
	AI:
		Better calculation for number of armies to transfer after defeating a country
		Better logic for AI attacks
		AI speed (ie, pause time between moves)
		AI difficulty
	Players:
		Support local human players (on the same device)
		Support remote human players (playing over the net)
	Settings:
		Battles:
			Always use max dice? checkbox
			Auto-battle checkbox (battle till someone dies)
		Players:
			Allow user to name players
			Give players default names based on color or number
			Choose player colors
			Add pop-up menu with a table for all the player settings
			When selecting number of players, give up and down buttons for mobile
		Sounds:
			Volume control
			Sound effects? checkbox
		Skins:
			Choose music themes
			Choose skins
			Tie a skin to its associated music theme, but also let them be chosen separately
		AI:
			AI speed (ie, pause time between moves)
			AI difficulty
	UI:
		Mobile:
			Don't register double-clicks, because that zooms instead of attacking
			Adjust the map size so that the entire map can be seen along with status text
			Allow the user to go "full-screen"
				In normal mode: Add a full-screen icon to the bottom-right of the canvas that activates full-screen
				Move status text onto the canvas
				Move the buttons onto the canvas
				Probably shrink the buttons and style the text
				Don't overshadow the map with the text or buttons
				Add a normal-screen icon to the bottom-right, similar to YouTube
		Skins:
			Take photos of my own game boards as source map images
			Support different maps
			Ensure that continent logic works for different maps
			Allow URL routes to skins (either as a param or a /)
		Sounds:
			Music:
				Load intro music at game load
				Support multiple songs per track, and tie tracks to game state (combat, settings, etc)
				Loop music tracks
				Support music themes
				Scrape and upload different songs
				Add different types of music to different parts of the game
			Sound effects:
				Support effects
				Dice rolls
				Victory shout
	Misc/Organization:
		Rename playerOrder to turnOrder?
		Refactor playerOrder, playerColors, etc to all be in a players array or object?
		Combine getCountry and getContinent?
		Join things together in classes?
		Move helpers to another file (or maybe organize code into more than 2 files using logical breaks)
	Bugs:
		When the human player starts their attack phase, the most recent attack shows in the status bar
		The human player can attack and reinforce from anywhere to anywhere as long as the controllers line up
		When AI tries to use the dice roller, the app hangs
		The "Waiting for non-combat" status doesn't show on the human player's non-combat phase
		The reinforcement number alert happens before the countries are redrawn
		When populating the world, if I go first, the last click places my first reinforcement army
		Fix formatting on t-rex-runner mini-game when called using param (or remove param support)
	
DONE:
	Bugs:
		Sometimes the AI picks my contry while placing armies
		Why are the countries showing the wrong name during AI attack?
		Why are no attacks being made by AI? (Global vars weren't being reset)
		When attacking, sometimes the AI leaves its own countries with 0 armies
		Get AI to take a turn after me (currently nothing happens)
		The first army is placed for me when I go first and I am using manual placement
		The dice roller doesn't "pause" the game
		Make "Would you like to start a new game?" work when changing new game settings
		Don't bug out when continuing after a player is eliminated in a multiplayer game
		When I eliminate player 2 (red) first in a 3-player game, I'm declared the winner
	Gameplay:
		Placing armies:
			Initial placement:
				Wait for the human player to place an army before the AI places their next army
				Add logic for option to claim contries manually (random placement already works)
			Refactor getRandomCountry() to filter on valid countries
			Turn-based placement:
				Calculate number of armies for reinforcement phase
		Battles:
			Add dumb logic for AI to attack
			After a win, transfer armies from the attacking country to the defending country
			Allow the human player to attack
			Use dice for battles
				Calculate how many dice to use for the attacker and defender
				Allow rerolls
		Taking turns:
			Support the non-combat phase
			Pass the turn after non-combat
			Also allow to pass the turn without taking a non-combat action
			Detect end of game and declare the winner
	Players:
		Allow for more than 2 players
		Support AI players
	Settings:
		Battles:
			Use dice? checkbox (when unchecked, use deterministic logic)
		Sounds:
			Move mute to settings
	Sounds:
		Music:
			Add main screen music
	UI:
		Dice roller:
			Reorganize dice elements to support text above and/or below each die
			Support using dice for attacks
			Use red dice for the attacker and white dice for the defender
	Misc/Organization:
		When clicking off a modal to close it, behave as though a close button was pressed
		Add t-rex-runner mini-game easter egg
		Turn PHASE_ORDER and gameStateOrder into global enums

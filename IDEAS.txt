
Way to think of players:
	Instead of referring to players by number (Player 1, Player 2, etc), refer to them by color (Red, Yellow, etc)

Possible fun futures:
	"Skins":
		Each skin would consist of: A map, with unique territories (that I would have to point in countinents), and songs for the various screens
		Skins would be built around themes, such as:
			Legend of Zelda: Hyrule
			Lord of the Rings: Middle Earth
			Shadowrun: Redrawn Earth
			Starcraft: Koprulu Sector
			Star Trek: Federation vs Klingons vs Dominion etc
			Warcraft: Azeroth
	Music sets/themes:
		User could select in settings
		Store music themes and/or skins in dedicated folders, then use folder names to populate selections
			Use the first part of file names to identify when a song should be played?
		Would be independent of skins, but skins would/could overwrite this
		Possible music themes:
			Classical music
			SSB
			Marvel
			Batman/Superman
			Pirates of the Caribbean

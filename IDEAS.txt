Rebrand:
	Rather than brand this as a Risk clone, make this my own thing, inspired by Risk
	Call it "World Conquest"?

Way to think of players:
	Instead of referring to players by number (Player 1, Player 2, etc), refer to them by color (Red, Yellow, etc)
	When showing players in the dice roller (and maybe other places), change the color of the text of their names to their color

Sweet settings:
	Allow "superpowers":
		When toggled on, players could spent armies during their reinforcement phase to buy superpowers
		Examples:
			3 armies: Attack anywhere
			4 armies: Trade in cards at the next highest tier
			2 armies: Unlimited reinforcement moves
			1 army: Reinforce anywhere
		When fixing the attack anywhere bug, add a setting to enable this as a feature

Possible fun futures:
	"Skins":
		Each skin would consist of: A map, with unique territories (that I would have to point in countinents), and songs for the various screens
		Skins would be built around themes, such as:
			Legend of Zelda: Hyrule
			Lord of the Rings: Middle Earth
				Intro music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SBQvd6vY9s&t=2185s
			Shadowrun: Redrawn Earth
			Starcraft: Koprulu Sector
			Star Trek: Federation vs Klingons vs Dominion etc
			Warcraft: Azeroth
	Music sets/themes:
		User could select in settings
		Store music themes and/or skins in dedicated folders, then use folder names to populate selections
			Use the first part of file names to identify when a song should be played?
		Would be independent of skins, but skins would/could overwrite this
		Possible music themes:
			Batman/Superman
			Classical music
			Halo
			Marvel
			Pirates of the Caribbean
			SSB

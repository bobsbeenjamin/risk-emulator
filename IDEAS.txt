
Possible fun futures:
	"Skins":
		Each skin would consist of: A map, with unique territories (that I would have to point in countinents), and songs for the various screens
		Skins would be built around themes, such as:
			Legend of Zelda: Hyrule
			Lord of the Rings: Middle Earth
			Shadowrun: Redrawn Earth
			Starcraft: Koprulu Sector
			Warcraft: Azeroth
	Music sets/themes:
		User could select in settings
		Would be independent of skins, but skins would/could overwrite this
		Possible music themes:
			Classical music
			SSB
			Marvel
			Batman/Superman
			Pirates of the Caribbean


Possible fun futures:
	"Skins"
		Each skin would consist of: A map, with unique territories (that I would have to point in countinents), and songs for the various screens
		Skins would be built around themes, such as:
			Legend of Zelda: Hyrule
			Lord of the Rings: Middle Earth
			Shadowrun: Redrawn Earth

Possible music scores:
	P.I. Tchaikovsky â€“ Swan Lake, Act II: No.10 Scene (Moderato)
